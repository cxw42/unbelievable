=head1 NAME

unbelievable - Yet another site generator (can you believe it?)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    unbelievable new <sitename>
    cd <sitename>
    unbelievable build

Say C<unbelievable --man> for full documentation.  Available subcommands
are C<new>, C<build>, and C<help>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<unbelievable> makes static sites using L<Dancer2> and L<wallflower>.
The inputs are UTF-8 encoded Markdown files, or HTML files or other assets.
Your site is a full Dancer2 application, so can do anything you want!
Databases, fancy templating --- the sky's the limit.

To build your static site, C<unbelievable> requests every file in the
C<public/> and C<content/> directories of your application.  C<public/>
usually holds your static files (e.g., images and CSS), just like in a regular
Dancer2 application.  C<content/> generally holds your Markdown files.
For example, C<content/foo.md> will be accessible (unless you say otherwise
in your Dancer2 code) as C</foo> and C</foo/>.
